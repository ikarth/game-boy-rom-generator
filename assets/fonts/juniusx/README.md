A new version of the Junicode font (previously hosted on Sourceforge) featuring full compliance with
the [Medieval Unicode Font Initiative](https://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/m.php?p=mufi) specification (version 4.0) and including all medieval characters
added to Unicode since MUFI 4.0. The font:

- is made with the [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) font editor;
- has the same character set in all faces;
- has five weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold)
- and three widths (Regular, SemiCondensed, Condensed);
- has improved outlines,
- an expanded collection of small caps (covering all case-paired characters),
- a more comprehensive set of anchors for mark positioning,
- and additional OpenType features—automatic runic transcription, access to fleurons, and more.

For a specimen of the roman face and a demonstration of the font’s many OpenType features, visit
[this page](https://psb1558.github.io/Junicode-New/).

All this is very much in progress. As of 23 May 2020, the roman face is complete (though metrics, anchors, and some
features still need work), and work on the italic is about 43% complete.
