<p>Wiking by Heinz KÃ¶nig was originally released in 1925 at the type foundry J. D. Trennert & Sohn in Hamburg. FDI Wiking is a carefully crafted revival released for free under the Open Font License. This was made possible by the generous support of people around the world, who pledged for this project on Kickstarter. </p>
<p>FDI Wiking has around 400 glyphs covering Western, Eastern and Central European Latin. Many characters have alternative glyphs, so both traditional German blackletter typesetting and international use with improved legibility is possible. </p>
